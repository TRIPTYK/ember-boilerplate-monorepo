# Product Mission

## Problem

Organizations struggle to maintain GDPR-compliant records of personal data processing activities. The regulatory requirements are complex, and managing this documentation manually or with generic tools is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Target Users

- **DPOs (Data Protection Officers) and compliance teams** — Primary users responsible for maintaining GDPR compliance
- **Small to medium businesses** — Companies needing compliance without dedicated legal teams
- **Any organization processing personal data in the EU** — Broad audience with GDPR obligations
- **Enterprise compliance departments** — Large organizations with complex data processing needs

## Solution

Registr combines three unique advantages:

1. **Privacy-first architecture** — Offline-first with SQLite via WASM. Sensitive compliance data stays on the user's device; only authentication is verified online.

2. **Guided usability** — 8-step wizard transforms complex GDPR requirements into a manageable workflow. Users are guided through every aspect of documenting data processing activities.

3. **Autonomous deployment** — Fully self-contained PWA requiring no server infrastructure for data storage. Organizations maintain complete control over their compliance records.

This combination makes GDPR compliance accessible, secure, and manageable for organizations of any size.
